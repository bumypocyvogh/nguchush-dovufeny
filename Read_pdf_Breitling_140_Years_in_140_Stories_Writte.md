This is an unconventional telling of a brand historyâ€”but then Breitling has never been one to follow the rules.
 
 In 1884, from a modest Swiss workshop, Leon Breitling began a legacy that would redefine the modern chronograph, champion the skies as the official timekeeper of civil aviation, launch a wristwatch into space, and put the first international emergency beacon in a timepiece.
 
 Delve into a collection of 140 stories, packed with intimate photos, first-person accounts, and a visual feast of more than 100 vintage and modern watches. This is where youâ€™ll meet the visionary leaders, captivating timepieces, and game-changing moves that etched Breitlingâ€™s name in history.
 
 As intricate as the mechanisms of its timepieces, this book celebrates Breitlingâ€™s commitment to craft, culture, and innovation. An exploration of a legacy, designed not just for those who appreciate the mechanics of a luxury watch, but for anyone inspired by the progress of ingenuity.
