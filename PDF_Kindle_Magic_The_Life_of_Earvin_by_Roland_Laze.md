Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller From the guy who wrote the definitive biography of Michael Jordan comes the definitive biography of Magic Johnson. From his life on the court to his fight with HIV/AIDS off the court, this is an unprecented look at a basketball icon. The definitive biography of the basketball legend Earvin ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Johnson, from the highly respected, career sportswriter and author of Michael Jordan: The Life.
 
 Magic Johnson is one of the most beloved, and at times controversial, athletes in history. His iconic smile lifted the dowdy sport of American professional basketball from a second-tier sport with low ratings into the global spotlight‚Äîa transformation driven by Magic‚Äôs ability to eviscerate opponents with a playing style that featured his grand sense of fun. He was a master entertainer who directed the Los Angeles ‚ÄúShowtime‚Äù Lakers to the heights of both glory and epic excess, all of it driven by his mind-blowing no-look passes and personal charm.
 
 Then, in 1991, at the height of his charismatic power, Johnson shocked the world with a startling cautionary tale about sexually transmitted disease that pushed public awareness of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Then out came his confession of unprotected sex with hundreds of women each year, followed by his retirement, an attempted return, and a proper farewell on the iconic 1992 Olympic Dream Team.
 
 Longtime biographer Roland Lazenby spent years tracking the unlikely ascension of Johnson‚Äîan immensely popular public figure who was instantly scandalized but who then turned to his legendary will to rise again as a successful entrepreneur with another level of hard-won success. In Lazenby‚Äôs portrayal, Johnson‚Äôs tale becomes bigger than that of one man. It is a generational saga spanning parts of three centuries that reveals a great deal, not just about his unique basketball journey but about America itself.
 
 Through hundreds of interviews with Johnson‚Äôs coaches, representatives past and present, teammates, opponents, friends, and loved ones, as well as key conversations with Johnson himself over the years, Lazenby has produced the first truly definitive study, both dark and light, of Earvin ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Johnson, Jr.‚Äîthe revolutionary player, the icon, the man.
